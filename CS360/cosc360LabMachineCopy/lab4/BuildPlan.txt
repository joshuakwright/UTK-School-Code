3. Add conditions to exclude '.', '..', and any soft links - done
4. Add conditions to recoginze multiple hard links - done
5. Ouput file contents to stdout - done
6. Use stat / (other needed system calls) to print out file info - done

tarx layout: 

1. write code to read in header directory
    - read of stdin
    - read file name size
    - read file name
    - read inode
    - read mode
    - read modification time
    - output to stdout in correct form for testing
2. create loop to read in all info and print to stdout
    - create jrb tree to store inodes
    - alter read function to read in what it needs to
    - creat file struct to store file details
    - write recursive function to open and create files/directories
    - only set directory mode after all it's contents have been created
3. Write function to create directory with correct info
4. use info to create all files and directories correctly
    - must create all files and subdirectories before setting permissions on each directory
