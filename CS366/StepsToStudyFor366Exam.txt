	- high to low when pushing to the stack
	- args pushed to stack in reverse order of code
	- then the return address $eip

Notes from quizes: 
	What's the side-channel attack? 
	Your Answer:
	This is when you are try to extract information from a system not by the means of the main channel 
	/ standard use places, but by indirect methods such as power leaks, sound, or by looking at data during 
	the wrong times.

Three attack models against the PKI and why the three models can be failed. Why are the attacks failed?
1. an adversary has no private associated with the public key of the certificate
2. The certificate is not issued by a CA.  In other words, the certificate cannot be certified.
3. Common name does not match the domain name that a victim tries to access.

- Asymmetric crypto is being used for DNSSEC.
- We have discussed it in class. Can you explain how it can happen? 
A user accesses apple.com, but the page is totally different from the legitimate Apple website.
	- Cyrillic "Ð°" (U+0430) rather than the ASCII "a" (U+0061).

What's the security mindset? and please provide a real-world example of the security mindset.
	- This is thinking like an attacker. When designing and setting up our security systems, 
	we need to think like an attacker in every way. What can we exploit? What are we assuming 
	is safe and how can we manipulate that? Are our assumptions true? This is being able to think 
	about your system and all of its functioning parts in a way that will allow you to mitigate threats 
	and prevent unauthorized access and use of the system. 

The TLS client should include at least three areas from below (-5 points each): 
	- common name - expiration date - chain of trust - serial number

Midterm Q: 6
	- static vars in bss
	- global in data
- ECB is used frequently in the world because it is the default api
- Side channel attacks happen when attacking a system from a non usual area, like listening to the
sound of each keystroke to infer what was typed
- hashing user passwords does not provide enough entropy to be a good encryption
- In modern unix, the owner of a file can not change the owner of the file to be another user
- ebp and eip are both 4 bytes
