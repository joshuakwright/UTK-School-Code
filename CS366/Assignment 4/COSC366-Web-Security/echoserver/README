Example of usage:

In another terminal, use these commands to test that the echo server is working.
Note that the echo server can only accept one connection at a time, so make sure the 
test connection is closed before you try to use the echo server for a task.

    [paul@localhost paul]$ telnet localhost 5555
    Trying 127.0.0.1...

Installation
============

If your system supports make, simply type:

    make

at the command line. Otherwise, compile and link echoserv.c and
help.c in the usual way to create the executable. You may or may
not need to link in additional libraries for the sockets functions;
check your compiler's documentation.
