Study List:

2. Go over clicker questions

3. Go over homework

4. Make sure you know how to do all the objectives listed below

Below are the seven learning outcomes that will be assessed on this exam:

1. Be able to produce an equivalent DFA (via state diagram) from a given 
	NFA (along with reduction of states in the DFA).

2. Given a regular expression, be able to describe the language generated 
	and/or indicate if a particular string would be in the language.

3. Given a 5-tuple definition of a finite automata, be able to draw the 
	corresponding state diagram.

4. Be able to produce a DFA for a language using the cross-product of two 
	simpler DFAs.

5. Be able to produce a DFA for a language using the complement of a simpler DFA.

6. Given a context-free grammar (CFG), be able to produce a derivation or
	parse tree for a string in the language described by the CFG and also 
	be able to determine if a given string would be in the language described 
	by the CFG.

7. Be able to use the Pumping Lemma (PL) to show that a given language is not regular.
