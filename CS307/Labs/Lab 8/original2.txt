
My computer ate my homework.
Yes, it's troublesome, but true.
Though it didn't gnaw or nibble
and it didn't chomp or chew.

It devoured days of typing,
every picture, chart and graph,
but the worst thing about it 
was I thought I heard it laugh.

But I found a good solution
and I smiled to hear the crash,
when I chucked it out the window
and it landed in the trash.

My computer ate my homework.
Yes, it's troublesome, but true.
I thought I knew what I was doing,
but it's clear I had no clue.

It wiped out days of typing,
every keystroke that I'd made,
What really got me though, 
was it could have all been saved

But I found a good solution
and I smiled to hear the crash,
when I chucked it out the window
and it landed in the trash.
