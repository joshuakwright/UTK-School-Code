Problem 1:
a. n^2
b. 1
c. N
d. NlogN
e. logN
f. 2^N

Problem 2:
a. 1
b. N

Problem 3:
a. N
b. N

Problem 4:
N^1/2 is the square root of N so it's time will be only a fraction of N. But
logN is saying 10 to the power of what = N. As N grows, 10's exponent grows much
slower than N's square root.
